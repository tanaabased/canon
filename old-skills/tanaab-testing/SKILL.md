# Tanaab Testing

## Overview

Use this skill for testing strategy, targeted test implementation, coverage policy, and test gating within the Tanaab coding hierarchy.

## When to Use

- The request adds, expands, or tightens test coverage for repository code.
- The task needs unit-test structure, coverage policy, or test-gate wiring in CI or release workflows.
- The user wants focused regression protection after implementation changes.
- The request specifically calls for Mocha-based unit tests or per-file coverage enforcement for JavaScript or TypeScript utility modules.
- The task needs JavaScript GitHub Action input parsing tests or workflow-driven action smoke coverage.
- The task needs Leia-backed markdown scenarios, CI-only destructive example coverage, or release-shaped artifact smoke tests for shell or bootstrap flows.

## When Not to Use

- Do not use this skill for implementation-only work that does not add or change tests.
- Do not use this skill for browser E2E or non-repository test systems unless the user asks for them explicitly.

## Relationship to Other Skills

- Assume `tanaab-coding-core` is active.
- Primary ownership: test scope, test conventions, coverage policy, threshold decisions, and recommendations for where tests should gate work.
- Defer implementation code changes to the owning implementation skill.
- Defer workflow YAML placement of test gates to `tanaab-github-actions`.
- Defer release-readiness narrative to `tanaab-release`.
- Pair with `tanaab-javascript` for JavaScript or TypeScript test implementation.
- Pair with `tanaab-frontend` for frontend component, theme, or static-site regression coverage.
- Pair with `tanaab-github-actions` when tests or coverage gates need CI workflow changes.
- Pair with `tanaab-release` when test results gate release readiness.
- Use `tanaab-templates` when a reusable test scaffold or fixture pattern should be applied.

## Workflow

1. Confirm `tanaab-coding-core` is active.
2. Scope the testing surface: target modules, desired test depth, coverage expectations, and workflow gates.
3. Add minimal test dependencies.

- Add `mocha` for test execution when the repository uses the Mocha path.
- Add `c8` only when coverage enforcement or coverage reporting is required.
- Prefer built-in runtime modules such as `node:assert/strict`, `node:fs`, `node:path`, and `node:os` over extra assertion or stubbing libraries when possible.

4. Add or update focused tests.

- Create a top-level `test/` directory when introducing this style for the first time.
- For `utils/X.js`, prefer `test/X.spec.js`.
- Keep scope limited to the requested unit surface instead of expanding into integration tests.
- Name tests with `it('should ...')`.
- Keep setup and teardown local to each spec file.
- Cover normal paths, edge cases, and error paths.
- For JavaScript GitHub Actions, isolate input parsing in a helper such as `utils/get-inputs.js` and unit test it by stubbing `@actions/core` getters plus `process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS` or fallback env vars.
- Restore the original `@actions/core` methods and relevant env vars in `afterEach` so GitHub Action input specs do not leak state across tests.
- Keep action unit tests pure and reserve `uses: ./` workflow runs for smoke tests that need real runner, checkout, permissions, or matrix behavior.
- Use `templates/testing/github-action-input/` when scaffolding the focused GitHub Action input helper pattern.
- Use `templates/github-actions/` with `tanaab-github-actions` when scaffolding workflow-driven action smoke tests and assertion steps.
- For shell or hosted-script repos with executable example READMEs, apply [references/leia-markdown-scenarios.md](./references/leia-markdown-scenarios.md) instead of inventing a repo-specific scenario shape.
- Use `templates/testing/leia-markdown-example/` and `templates/github-actions/` with `tanaab-github-actions` when standardizing the Leia pattern.
- Treat Leia scenarios that mutate machine state, install packages, touch user configuration, or rely on secrets as CI-first coverage and do not run them locally unless the user explicitly asked for a local Leia run.

5. Add or update test scripts and coverage policy.

- Add a `test` script that runs Mocha, optionally through `c8`.
- Do not invent a local `test` script for Leia-only scenario suites when the examples are intentionally CI-only because they mutate machine state, install packages, or rely on secrets.
- For per-file thresholds, prefer `c8 --all --include "utils/*.js" --check-coverage --per-file --lines 80 mocha "test/**/*.spec.js"` when that scope matches the repo.

6. Wire CI and release gates intentionally.

- Do not add `bun run test` to every workflow by default.
- Add `bun run test` to release, deploy, or dedicated PR validation workflows when the repository needs those gates.
- Place test steps before build, publish, or deploy steps so failures block downstream actions.
- Add a standalone PR unit-test workflow when one is needed and does not already exist.

7. Pull from `tanaab-javascript`, `tanaab-github-actions`, `tanaab-release`, or `tanaab-templates` when the task crosses those boundaries.

## Validation

- Confirm `tanaab-coding-core` is active.
- Confirm the test scope matches the request.
- Confirm this skill stayed the primary owner only for test and coverage surfaces.
- Confirm any CI or release gate changes are explicit.
- Run `bun run test` when the repository has a safe local test script for the changed surface; otherwise run the relevant focused test command or CI-equivalent workflow path.
- Run `bun run lint` when linting is part of repo standards.
- Confirm coverage output meets the requested threshold when coverage was part of the task.
- Confirm GitHub Action input parsing tests cover both local-default and GitHub Actions-runtime cases when that surface changed.
- Confirm workflow-driven action smoke coverage exists when real runner behavior, permissions, or matrix behavior changed.
- Confirm Leia-backed scenarios follow [references/leia-markdown-scenarios.md](./references/leia-markdown-scenarios.md) when that surface changed.
- Confirm Leia-backed scenarios use fenced code blocks, blank-line-separated `# should ...` test headers, and no blank lines inside a single test body.
- Confirm machine-mutating Leia scenarios were not run locally unless the user explicitly requested a local Leia run.
- Confirm any template use came from `tanaab-templates`.
