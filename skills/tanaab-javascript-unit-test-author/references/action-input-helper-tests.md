# Action Input Helper Tests

Use this starter pattern when a JavaScript GitHub Action has a dedicated input-normalization helper such as `utils/get-inputs.js`.

## What This Pattern Covers

- Preserves the original `@actions/core` getter methods before each test mutates them.
- Replaces `getInput`, `getBooleanInput`, and `getMultilineInput` with map-backed test doubles.
- Preserves and restores `process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS` plus any fallback env vars the helper reads.
- Verifies both local-default behavior and explicit GitHub Actions runtime behavior.

## What It Does Not Cover

- End-to-end action execution through `uses: ./`
- Runner-specific shell or filesystem behavior
- Permission, checkout, or sync behavior

Use workflow smoke tests for those broader surfaces.

## Starter File

- [`../templates/get-inputs.spec.js`](../templates/get-inputs.spec.js): Mocha starter for a focused input-helper spec

Rename the example input keys, helper path, and expected result fields to match the action you are testing.
