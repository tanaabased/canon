# JavaScript Action Conventions

Use these rules when a GitHub Action repository's product surface is a JavaScript-backed action executed with Bun.

This file is local to `tanaab-github-action-author` because it is action-product doctrine, not a shared rule for every workflow or JavaScript task.

## Runtime Shape

- Prefer `runs.using: "composite"` even for JavaScript-backed actions so the wrapper can install Bun and execute the built runtime artifact explicitly.
- Keep the real runtime logic in ESM JavaScript files and keep `action.yml` focused on inputs, setup, and invoking the built artifact.
- Export action inputs into `INPUT_*` env vars explicitly in the composite step when the runtime code relies on `@actions/core` getters.
- Keep the entrypoint path stable, usually `${{ github.action_path }}/dist/index.js`.

## Build and Distribution

- Compile the runtime with `bun build` to `dist/index.js`.
- Prefer a build script such as `bun build ./entry.js --target=bun --format=esm --sourcemap=linked --outdir dist --entry-naming index.js`.
- Commit `dist/index.js` and related sourcemaps when action consumers load the action directly from repository refs or Marketplace tags.
- Keep `package.json` `main` and `exports` aligned to the built artifact when the repo is also published as a package.
- Use `prepare` or equivalent release plumbing so committed action artifacts do not drift from source.

## Tests and Workflows

- Keep input parsing in a dedicated helper such as `utils/get-inputs.js`.
- Unit test that helper by stubbing `@actions/core` getter methods and toggling `process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS` so local-default and real Actions-runtime behavior are both covered.
- Use `uses: ./` in workflow-driven smoke tests for end-to-end action behavior, permissions, sync flows, or OS matrix coverage.
- Split PR workflows by surface when the repo benefits from separate lint, unit, options, and sync validation.
- Use `fetch-depth: 0` only in workflows that actually need tags, full history, or sync behavior.
- In workflow-driven smoke tests, assert observable postconditions after the action runs, such as file mutations, tags, config changes, or verification state.
- Prefer one assertion step per postcondition, use `if: always()` when later checks should still execute after a failure, and emit `::notice` or `::error` annotations with a real non-zero exit code.
- Keep assertion steps short and shell-native until the logic becomes complex enough to extract into a repo-authored helper script.

## Release Workflow

- For JavaScript-backed action repos that maintain committed `dist/` artifacts or sync `CHANGELOG.md`, prefer a release-published workflow that checks out full history, installs Bun, exports `RELEASE_DATE`, and calls `tanaabased/prepare-release-action@v1`.
- Keep `actions/checkout@v6` at `fetch-depth: 0` when the release flow needs tags, history, or sync behavior.
- Keep the `Export formatted release date` step because `prepare-release-action` uses `RELEASE_DATE` when stamping the changelog.
- Treat `Install deps and prep` as optional. Keep it only when a final lint, test, build, or smoke pass materially validates or regenerates the shipped action surface.
- Keep `sync-tags` on the moving major alias that corresponds to the incoming release tag. For example, a published tag such as `v1.2.3` should sync `v1`.
- Use the `commands` block to rebuild or stamp committed action artifacts before sync when the action ships versioned runtime files.
- In `release.yml`, use `tanaabased/prepare-release-action@v1`, not `uses: ./`.

## README and Repo Metadata

- Use the GitHub Action README variant so inputs, outputs, caveats, and usage stay in `README.md`, which is the Marketplace and repository entrypoint.
- Pin Bun with `.bun-version`, `packageManager`, and optionally `.tool-versions` when the repo tracks local tool versions there.
- Prefer Dependabot entries for both `bun` and `github-actions` ecosystems when the repo depends on them.
- Dogfood the action in repo workflows when that gives useful integration coverage.
